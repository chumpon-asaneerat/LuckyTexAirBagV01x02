The last session 
1. We update new code to Main projects and let you check then the files you create in last session contains 
   - @Documents\CODE_UPDATE_SUMMARY_2025-06-24.md
   - @Documents\.DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_TRACKER.md
   - @Documents\.COMPLETE_DOCUMENTATION_IMPACT_ANALYSIS.md

2. i ask you to create @Prompts\prompt_update.txt and 
   i ask 'Due to enomous amount of file i afraid that we cannot completed in one session. With your estimate that we need more than an hour to do full tasks. how we split work to do in multiple session?'
   after that you generate @Documents\.DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_PLAN_MULTISESSION.md and the session is reach limit so 
   please check is that complete my requested.

3. From what i see in @Documents\.DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_PLAN_MULTISESSION.md 
   i think over than 1 hour the session will surely reach limit so adjust it more smaller to 
   fit within 1 hour per session because we may need to chat/interrupt while you make update processes

4. i think the @Prompts\prompt_update.txt may need to update and if it too messy let compact it 
   for you to work properly without make mistake.
