Check all instructions in @Documents\Database

Strict with all instructions and TEMPLATE_INDIVIDUAL_PROCEDURE.md do not violate it you alrady broke my instruction more than 10 sections
i waste time to correct it DO NOT done it again.

DO NOT use Batch processing causes it lose progress when session ends. you should:
- Generate ONE file at a time
- Update tracker after EACH file
- Save progress continuously
- No need to ask me every time when process to generate file continue create it.
This way if session ends, all completed work is saved. 

So continue properly do one file at a time then updating tracker after complete each file generated
