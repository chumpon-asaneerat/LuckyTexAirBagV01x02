## Business Logic (What it does and why)

Retrieves all machine stop events recorded for a specific beam roll during production.

**Purpose**: When operator or supervisor reviews a beam roll, they need to see:
- Why the machine stopped during production
- How many times it stopped
- Where (at what length) each stop occurred
- Who recorded each stop event

This data is critical for:
- **Production Analysis**: Understanding downtime causes
- **Quality Investigation**: Stops may correlate with defects
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculating machine efficiency
- **Operator Accountability**: Tracking who handled each stop

**When Used**:
- **Production Review**: Supervisor checks stop history for a beam
- **Edit Beam Screen**: Display stop events when editing beam data
- **Quality Analysis**: Investigating quality issues related to stops
- **Performance Reports**: Calculating downtime by stop reason

**Business Rules**:
- Multiple stop events may exist for a single beam lot
- Each stop records the exact length at which it occurred
- OTHERFLAG='Y' indicates operator entered custom stop reason text
- Empty result means the beam had no recorded stops (uninterrupted production)
- Stops are recorded by operator using "Insert Stop" button during production

**Data Flow**:
1. During production, machine stops (breakdown, yarn break, etc.)
2. Operator records stop reason via UI (calls BEAM_INSERTBEAMMCSTOP)
3. Later, when reviewing production, this procedure retrieves all stops
4. UI displays stop history as a list or timeline
