## Business Logic (What it does and why)

Retrieves the list of warp rolls (from M02-Warping) that were used as input material for a specific beaming setup.

**Purpose**: This is a critical **traceability query** that links beaming production back to its source warp rolls. When supervisor or quality team needs to:
- Track which warp beams went into a specific beaming batch
- Trace back from finished beam to raw warp materials
- Investigate quality issues (which warp rolls may have caused defects)
- Generate production reports showing material consumption

**When Used**:
- **Traceability Reports**: Showing forward/backward material flow
- **Quality Investigation**: Finding which warp rolls were used
- **Edit Beaming Setup**: Display list of warp rolls in the setup
- **Production Analysis**: Understanding material usage patterns
- **Transfer Slip**: Document source materials on transfer documents

**Business Rules**:
- Multiple warp rolls combine into one beaming setup (many-to-one relationship)
- Each warp roll (WARPERLOT) belongs to a warp setup (WARPHEADNO)
- Mapping is created during beaming setup via BEAM_INSERTBEAMERROLLSETTING
- This is historical data - shows what was SET UP, not necessarily what was used
- Empty result means beaming setup has no warp roll mappings (data issue)

**Data Flow**:
1. During beaming setup, operator selects warp rolls
2. System calls BEAM_INSERTBEAMERROLLSETTING to record mappings
3. Later, this procedure retrieves the mappings for display/reports
4. Used in forward traceability: WARPERLOT â†’ BEAMERNO â†’ (next process)
