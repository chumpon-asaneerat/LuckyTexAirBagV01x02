## Business Logic (What it does and why)

**Purpose**: Calculate total defect points within the current 100-meter section to determine if quality threshold is exceeded.

**When Used**: **Real-time during inspection** - called immediately after operator enters each defect to check if the 100M section has accumulated too many defect points (quality alert system).

**Business Rules**:
1. Requires valid INSLOT and DEFECTID (both cannot be null/empty)
2. Calculates defect points for current 100-meter section only
3. **Critical Quality Rule**: If defect points exceed 10 points in any 100M section, system alerts operator
4. Works with two defect types:
   - **Point defects**: Single position (LENGTH2 is null)
   - **Long defects**: Start and end position (both LENGTH1 and LENGTH2 provided)
5. Called in real-time as defects are recorded during inspection
6. Used for immediate quality feedback to operator

**100-Meter Quality System**:
- Fabric is evaluated in 100-meter sections
- Each defect type has point value (based on severity)
- Total points per 100M section determines grade
- **> 10 points in any 100M section** = Quality alert (system warns operator)
- Helps catch quality issues during inspection, not after completion

**Workflow**:
1. **Point Defect Entry**:
   - Operator enters defect code and position at current counter length
   - System calls INS_GET100MDEFECTPOINT with current length (LENGTH1 only)
   - Stored procedure calculates points in current 100M section
   - If > 10 points: "Defect in 100 m Over 10 Point" alert displayed

2. **Long Defect Entry** (defects spanning multiple meters):
   - Operator marks defect start position
   - Operator marks defect end position when fabric advances
   - System calls INS_GET100MDEFECTPOINT with start (LENGTH1) and end (LENGTH2)
   - Stored procedure calculates points for the defect span
   - If > 10 points: Alert displayed

3. **Quality Monitoring**:
   - Continuous monitoring during inspection process
   - Immediate feedback if section quality deteriorates
   - Allows operator to notify production team in real-time
   - Prevents shipping fabric with excessive defects

**Why Real-Time Calculation**:
- Early warning system for quality issues
- Allows stopping production if patterns emerge
- Better than discovering issues after inspection complete
- Helps maintain customer quality standards
