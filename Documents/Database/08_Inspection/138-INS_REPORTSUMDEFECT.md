## Business Logic (What it does and why)

**Purpose**: Summarize defects by type with point totals and counts for inspection reporting.

**When Used**: Generating inspection reports that show defect breakdown by defect type (used in Report.xaml.cs).

**Business Rules**:
1. Both P_DEFECTID and P_ITMCODE required
2. Groups defects by defect code/type
3. Calculates:
   - Total points per defect type
   - Short defect counts (single position defects)
   - Long defect counts (spanning multiple meters)
   - Compensated defect counts
4. Used for quality analysis and reporting

**Defect Type Analysis**:
- **TOTALPOINT**: Sum of all defect points for each defect type
- **SHORTDEFECT**: Count of point defects (single location)
- **LONGDEFECT**: Count of continuous defects (start to end position)
- **COMSHORTDEFECT**: Short defects with compensation applied

**Report Usage**:
- Shows which defect types are most prevalent
- Helps identify quality issues by defect category
- Provides statistical analysis for quality improvement
- Customer reporting and quality documentation
