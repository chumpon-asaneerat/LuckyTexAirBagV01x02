## Business Logic (What it does and why)

**Purpose**: Retrieve comprehensive defect list for inspection lot reporting and printing. This is the **reporting version** of defect list retrieval (replaces older GETINSDEFECTLIST).

**When Used**:
- Generating inspection reports (printed reports)
- Displaying defect summary on inspection documentation
- Quality review and analysis
- Customer quality documentation

**Business Rules**:
1. Requires valid INSLOT (cannot be null/empty)
2. DEFECTID parameter is optional - if null/empty, returns all defects for the lot
3. Returns defect details WITH defect code descriptions (joined with defect master table)
4. Includes both active and deleted defects (DELETEBY field indicates deletion status)
5. Provides both regular defect points and 100M section points
6. Includes compensation length for defects that require fabric cut compensation

**Data Enrichment**:
- Joins defect records with defect code master table
- Provides `DESCRIPTION_EN` (English defect description) for reporting
- Calculates `DEFECTPOINT100` for 100-meter grading system
- Shows `COMPENSATELENGTH` for defects requiring length adjustment

**Report Usage Pattern**:
1. **Inspection Report Generation** (Report.xaml.cs):
   - Called when printing inspection reports
   - Retrieves complete defect list for the lot
   - Formats defect data for RDLC report
   - Shows defect code, position, length, and points
   - Used in multiple report templates (RepMasterForm.xaml.cs)

2. **Defect List Processing**:
   - C# code calculates defect length for long defects (LENGTH2 - LENGTH1)
   - Truncates decimal values for display (1 decimal place)
   - Orders defects by position for report readability

**Difference from Similar Procedures**:
- **vs GETINSDEFECTLIST**: This is the newer reporting version with enhanced fields
- **vs GetDefectList**: That's for editing, this is for reporting/printing
- Includes DESCRIPTION_EN for customer-facing reports
- Added 2016-02-08 to replace older defect list procedures
