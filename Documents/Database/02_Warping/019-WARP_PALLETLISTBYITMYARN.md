## Business Logic (What it does and why)

Retrieves available yarn pallets for a specific yarn item code during warping creel setup. When an operator is setting up yarn on the creel, they need to select which pallets to use. This procedure shows all pallets for the selected yarn type with remaining quantities.

**Workflow**:
1. Operator selects yarn item code on creel setup screen
2. System queries all pallets matching that yarn code
3. Calculates remaining cheese count for each pallet (RECEIVECH - USEDCH - REJECTCH)
4. Excludes pallets already allocated to current setup (via P_WARPHEADNO)
5. Returns sorted list (typically FIFO - oldest first)
6. Operator selects which pallets to use

**Business Rules**:
- Only shows pallets with remaining stock (FINISHFLAG != 'Y')
- Excludes returned pallets (RETURNFLAG = 'Y')
- Shows only verified pallets (VERIFY = 'Y') in production mode
- FIFO principle: oldest pallets (RECEIVEDATE) used first
- Each pallet tracks cheese count, not just weight
- Calculates available quantity dynamically

**Data Calculations (in C# code)**:
- `NoCH = RECEIVECH - USEDCH - REJECTCH` (available cheese count)
- `Use = NoCH` (default quantity to use - can be modified by operator)
- `Reject = 0` (default reject count - can be modified by operator)
- `Remain = NoCH - Use - Reject` (remaining after current allocation)
