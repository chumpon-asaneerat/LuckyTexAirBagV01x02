## Business Logic (What it does and why)

Updates yarn pallet usage quantities when operator allocates cheese from pallets during creel setup. This maintains accurate inventory tracking and links pallets to specific warping operations.

**Workflow**:
1. Operator creates creel setup and selects pallets
2. For each pallet, operator specifies:
   - How many cheese to use (USE)
   - How many cheese to reject (REJECT)
3. System calculates remaining: REMAIN = (RECEIVECH - USEDCH - REJECTCH) - USE - REJECT
4. System calls this procedure to update pallet record:
   - USEDCH += USE (cumulative used count)
   - REJECTCH += REJECT (cumulative reject count)
   - Links pallet to WARPHEADNO
5. If REMAIN = 0, sets FINISHFLAG = 'Y' (pallet fully consumed)
6. Pallet inventory updated for tracking and allocation

**Business Rules**:
- Updates are cumulative (adds to existing USEDCH and REJECTCH)
- Must not allow negative remaining quantity
- FINISHFLAG automatically set when pallet depleted:
  - `FINISHFLAG = 'Y' when (RECEIVECH - USEDCH - REJECTCH) = 0`
- Links pallet to specific warping operation via WARPHEADNO
- May update USEDWEIGHT based on USEDCH and KGPERCH ratio
- Validates that updated quantities don't exceed RECEIVECH

**Inventory Tracking**:
- **Before**: Pallet shows available cheese count
- **After**: Pallet shows reduced available count
- **If depleted**: FINISHFLAG = 'Y', pallet no longer appears in selection lists

**Related Business Logic**:
```
RECEIVECH = 100 (total received)
USEDCH = 40 (previously used)
REJECTCH = 5 (previously rejected)
Available = 55

Operator allocates: USE = 30, REJECT = 2

New values:
USEDCH = 40 + 30 = 70
REJECTCH = 5 + 2 = 7
Remaining = 100 - 70 - 7 = 23
FINISHFLAG = 'N' (still has stock)
```
