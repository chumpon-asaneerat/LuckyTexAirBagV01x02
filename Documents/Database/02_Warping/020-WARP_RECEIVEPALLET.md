## Business Logic (What it does and why)

Registers a new yarn pallet into the warping inventory system when yarn is received from the warehouse or supplier. This creates the initial inventory record that will be tracked throughout the warping process.

**Workflow**:
1. Warehouse delivers yarn pallet to warping department
2. Operator scans or enters pallet barcode
3. System verifies pallet doesn't already exist
4. Operator confirms yarn item code, weight, and cheese count
5. If pallet has quality issues, selects reject reason
6. System creates new pallet record with initial quantities
7. Pallet becomes available for creel setup operations

**Business Rules**:
- Pallet number must be unique (primary key constraint)
- Initial state: USEDCH = 0, REJECTCH = 0, FINISHFLAG = 'N'
- VERIFY field controls whether pallet can be used in production
- Rejected pallets (REJECTID set) may have restricted usage
- Creates audit trail (CREATEDATE, CREATEBY)
- Pallet weight and cheese count used for yield tracking

**Inventory Tracking**:
- `RECEIVEWEIGHT` = Initial weight received
- `RECEIVECH` = Initial cheese count
- `USEDWEIGHT` = 0 (not yet used)
- `USEDCH` = 0 (not yet used)
- `REJECTCH` = 0 (no rejects recorded yet)
- `FINISHFLAG` = 'N' (pallet still has stock)
