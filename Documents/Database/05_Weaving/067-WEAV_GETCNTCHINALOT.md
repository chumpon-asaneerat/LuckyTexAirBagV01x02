## Business Logic (What it does and why)

**Purpose**: Specialized procedure for tracking production lots destined for Chinese customers, which require special handling, documentation, or sequencing.

**Business Context**:
- LuckyTex produces airbag fabric for multiple customers globally
- Chinese customer orders have special requirements (documentation, quality specs, traceability)
- "China lots" need separate tracking and counting mechanisms
- Lot numbering may include country/customer-specific prefixes or sequences
- Count is used for validation, duplicate checking, or sequence generation

**Usage Scenarios**:

**Scenario 1: Lot Number Validation**
1. Operator enters or scans lot number during production setup
2. System calls WEAV_GETCNTCHINALOT to check if it's a valid China lot
3. If CNT = "1", lot is confirmed as China lot â†’ apply special rules
4. If CNT = "0", lot is regular lot â†’ standard processing
5. UI may display special indicators or enable additional fields for China lots

**Scenario 2: China Lot Sequence Generation**
1. Production planning creates new lot for Chinese customer order
2. System needs to generate next China lot number
3. Calls WEAV_GETCNTCHINALOT with date pattern to get current count
4. Increments count to generate new unique lot number
5. Example: CN-2024-10-0001, CN-2024-10-0002, etc.

**Scenario 3: Duplicate Lot Prevention**
1. Before creating new China lot, system validates uniqueness
2. Calls WEAV_GETCNTCHINALOT with proposed lot number
3. If CNT > 0, lot already exists â†’ prevent duplicate
4. If CNT = 0, lot is unique â†’ allow creation

**Scenario 4: Cross-Module Tracking (Beaming Usage)**
1. Beaming module needs to track China lots from upstream warping
2. Calls WEAV_GETCNTCHINALOT to verify if warp beam is for China lot
3. If yes, applies special beaming parameters or documentation
4. Maintains traceability through production chain

**Business Rules**:
- China lots may have specific naming conventions (prefix, format)
- Count is returned as STRING (not integer) for flexibility
- May track across multiple production stages (Warping â†’ Beaming â†’ Weaving)
- Used by both Weaving and Beaming modules (shared procedure)

**Special Handling for China Lots**:
- Enhanced quality documentation
- Specific customer labels and certifications
- Export documentation requirements
- Special packaging or marking
- Traceability reports in specific format

**Why Named "CHINALOT"**:
- "China" refers to customer destination country (China market)
- Not product origin (fabric made in Thailand)
- Specific customer requirements drive special handling

## Related Procedures

**Lot Number Generation/Validation**:
- May have similar procedures for other customer types (Japan, USA, Europe)
- General lot number validation procedures

**Cross-Module Usage**:
- Used in **WeavingDataService** (lines 354-380) - Weaving operations
- Used in **BeamingDataService** (lines 114-140) - Beaming operations
- Shows importance of tracking China lots through production chain

**Customer-Specific Logic**:
- Customer order lookup procedures
- Customer specification validation
- Export documentation generation
