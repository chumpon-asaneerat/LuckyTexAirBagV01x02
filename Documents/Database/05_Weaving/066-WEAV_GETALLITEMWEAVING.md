## Parameters

### Input (IN)

None - Returns all active weaving items

### Output (OUT)

None

### Returns (Cursor)

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `ITM_WEAVING` | VARCHAR2(50) | Weaving item code (product code for fabric) |
| `WIDTHWEAVING` | NUMBER | Standard fabric width in cm or inches |

## Business Logic (What it does and why)

**Purpose**: Provides a master list of all weaving item codes (fabric products) with their standard widths, used for item selection throughout the weaving module.

**Business Context**:
- Each fabric product has a unique item code (ITM_WEAVING)
- Each item has a standard fabric width specification
- Operators need to select item codes when setting up looms or recording production
- Width is critical specification for loom setup and quality control
- Item list populates dropdown lists across multiple weaving pages

**Usage Scenarios**:

**Scenario 1: Loom Setup**
1. Operator preparing to start production on a loom
2. Opens loom setup screen
3. System loads all available weaving items via WEAV_GETALLITEMWEAVING
4. Operator selects item code from dropdown (e.g., "FAB-AB-6070")
5. System auto-fills width specification (e.g., 60 cm)
6. Operator configures loom according to width and item spec

**Scenario 2: Production Recording**
1. Operator recording completed fabric roll
2. Selects item code from predefined list
3. Width validates against actual measured width
4. Production data includes both item code and width for traceability

**Scenario 3: Item Search/Filter**
1. User searching production history by item
2. System provides autocomplete suggestions from item list
3. User selects item to filter production records

**Business Rules**:
- Returns only active items (not discontinued products)
- Returns only items classified as weaving products (not yarn or other materials)
- Width is standard specification (not actual measured width)
- Item codes are unique across the system
- Width is used for validation and quality control

**Data Usage**:
- **ITM_WEAVING**: Displayed in dropdowns, used as key for other lookups
- **WIDTHWEAVING**: Displayed alongside item code, used for validation

**Related Master Data**:
- Item specifications (GSM, construction, composition)
- Customer item mapping (customer's item code â†’ internal code)
- Production standards (speed, tension, efficiency targets)

**Used By** (Procedures that reference items):
- [WEAVE_INSERTPROCESSSETTING](./WEAVE_INSERTPROCESSSETTING.md) - Validate item during setup
- [WEAV_WEAVINGPROCESS](./WEAV_WEAVINGPROCESS.md) - Record production by item
- Most other WEAV_ procedures that accept ITM_WEAVING parameter
