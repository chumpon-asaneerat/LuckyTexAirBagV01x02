## Quick Reference

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Purpose** | Delete entire weaving production lot (cancelled/rejected lot) |
| **Operation** | DELETE (CASCADE - multiple related tables) |
| **Called From** | WeavingDataService.cs:1882 ‚Üí WEAV_DELETEWEAVINGLOT() |
| **Frequency** | Low - Critical operation for cancelled production lots only |
| **Performance** | Medium - Cascade deletion affects multiple tables |
| **Issues** | üî¥ 1 High - Requires audit trail and authorization control |

## Business Logic (What it does and why)

**Purpose**: Completely removes a weaving production lot and all related data from the system, typically for cancelled or rejected lots that should not appear in production history.

**Business Context**:
- Weaving lots can be cancelled due to quality issues, setup errors, or production changes
- Complete deletion (vs. status change) is needed when lot should be completely erased from records
- This is a **critical operation** requiring supervisor/manager authorization
- Deletion affects traceability - all downstream processes must also be cancelled
- Audit trail is essential for compliance and quality management

**Usage Scenarios**:

**Scenario 1: Setup Error**
1. Operator starts weaving lot with wrong beam or item code
2. Mistake discovered immediately (no significant production yet)
3. Supervisor decides to delete lot completely and restart with correct setup
4. Enters reason: "Wrong beam loaded - setup error"
5. System deletes lot and frees up the beam for correct use

**Scenario 2: Quality Rejection**
1. Quality inspector finds critical defect affecting entire lot
2. Lot is rejected and cannot be used in any form
3. Manager authorizes complete deletion
4. Enters reason: "Critical quality defect - lot rejected by QA"
5. System removes lot from production records

**Scenario 3: Production Cancellation**
1. Customer cancels order, lot is only partially complete
2. Manager decides to cancel in-progress lot
3. Enters reason: "Customer order cancellation - SO#12345"
4. System deletes lot and returns beams to available inventory

**Business Rules**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **High-risk operation** - Should require supervisor/manager permission level
- Must validate lot status before deletion (should not delete completed/shipped lots)
- Must check for downstream processes (inspection, finishing) - cannot delete if used downstream
- Remark field is **mandatory** - must document why deletion occurred
- Operator name is **mandatory** - must track who authorized/performed deletion
- Should log to audit table **before** deletion (in case of rollback)

**Impact on Related Data**:
- Beam consumption reversed (beam becomes available again)
- Weft yarn usage records deleted
- Machine stop records deleted (affects OEE calculations - should recalculate)
- Production reports must exclude deleted lots
- Traceability chain is broken (beam ‚Üí lot ‚Üí fabric)

**When NOT to Use**:
- If lot has been inspected ‚Üí Use status change instead
- If lot has been shipped ‚Üí Cannot delete (integrity violation)
- If lot is referenced in downstream processes ‚Üí Must cancel downstream first
- For simple data corrections ‚Üí Use UPDATE procedures instead

## Related Procedures

**Before Deletion (Validation)**:
- [WEAV_GETWEAVELISTBYBEAMROLL](./WEAV_GETWEAVELISTBYBEAMROLL.md) - Check lot status
- [WEAV_WEAVINGINPROCESSLIST](./WEAV_WEAVINGINPROCESSLIST.md) - Verify lot is still in-process
- Should check: Finishing, Inspection, Packing status

**Related Deletion Operations**:
- [WEAV_DELETEMCSTOP](./WEAV_DELETEMCSTOP.md) - Delete individual machine stop (less severe)
- Similar DELETE procedures in other modules (BEAM_, WARP_, etc.)

**Audit/Logging**:
- Should call shared audit logging procedure
- May need to notify reporting system to recalculate metrics

**Inventory Impact**:
- May need to call inventory adjustment procedures
- Beam status update procedures
